Uptane has been adopted by several major automakers, which will lead to
its implementation in millions of vehicles. While the automotive industry
is legendarily secretive, we can acknowledge a few
parties.

First, Uptane is incorporated in
[Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/), which is
supported by
[major OEMs and suppliers](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/members).
This is via HERE's [aktualizr](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr)
implementation, which is also integrated in [GENIVI](https://www.genivi.org/).


Interested parties that wish to purchase Uptane compatible components can
speak with a number of suppliers, including:

* Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now part of
[HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/en), integrated Uptane
into its OTA solution, [HERE OTA Connect](https://docs.ota.here.com/index.html)
(formerly known as ATS Garage).
ATS/HERE was the first European third-party supplier to publicly
adopt the Uptane framework.

* [Airbiquity](https://www.airbiquity.com) incorporated Uptane into its
[OTAmatic](https://www.airbiquity.com/product-offerings/software-and-data-management)
over-the-air software and data management solution. The product was honored in
2017 with a
[Business Intelligence Group](https://www.bintelligence.com/) Award in the [New Product of the Year Award category](https://www.airbiquity.com/news/press-releases/airbiquity-otamatic-named-2017-new-product-year-business-intelligence-group).

* [Foundries.io](https://foundries.io/) integrates security aspects of TUF and Uptane into its
[OTA Connect](https://foundries.io/insights/2018/07/12/ota-part-4/) open-source server software. The software supports devices that are compatible with Aktualizr.
