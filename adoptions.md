Uptane has been adopted by several major automakers, which will lead to
its implementation in millions of vehicles. While the automotive industry
is legendarily secretive, we can acknowledge a few
parties.

First, Uptane is incorporated in
[Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/), which is
supported by
[major OEMs and suppliers](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/members).
This is via ATS's [aktualizr](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr)
implementation, which is also integrated in [GENIVI](https://www.genivi.org/).


Interested parties that wish to purchase Uptane compatible components can
speak with a number of suppliers, including:

* Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now
[HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/en), integrated Uptane
into two of its OTA solutions, [OTA Plus](https://www.here.com/en/products-services/here-automotive-suite/ota-software-management/here-ota-connect)
and [ATS Garage](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/ats-garage-docs). ATS
was the first European third-party supplier to publicly
adopt the Uptane framework.

* [Airbiquity](https://www.airbiquity.com) incorporated Uptane into its
[OTAmatic](https://www.airbiquity.com/product-offerings/software-and-data-management)
over-the-air software and data management solution. The product was honored in
2017 with a
[Business Intelligence Group](https://www.bintelligence.com/) Award in the [New Product of the Year Award category]((https://www.airbiquity.com/news/press-releases/airbiquity-otamatic-named-2017-new-product-year-business-intelligence-group).
