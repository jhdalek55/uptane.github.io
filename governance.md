# Uptane Governance

This document covers Uptane's governance and committer process. It also lists the individuals who serve on its Industry Advisory Group, and as the governing body of the Uptane Alliance.

### Uptane Alliance

In July of 2018, Uptane was officially adopted into IEEE's Industry Standards
and Technology Organization (ISTO) as the Uptane Alliance. Under the ISTO umbrella,
the Uptane Alliance will standardize the Uptane open-source software in order to ensure that manufacturers and suppliers
follow best practices for updates within the automotive industry. As an ISTO
organization, the Uptane Alliance will also be able to draw on a number of other
benefits, including non-profit status, and access to IEEE resources, such as conferences
and publications.

As an ISTO alliance, the Uptane Alliance has officially formed a Board of Directors and is governed by a set of bylaws. The Board of Directors are:

* Justin Cappos of NYU Tandon School of Engineering
* Ira McDonald of High North Inc.
* Andre Weimerskirch of Lear Corporation and University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute

The Uptane standards documents must be approved by a majority of the Uptane Alliance Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may also be changed by
action of a majority of board members.
