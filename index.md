Uptane is the first software update system designed to protect software delivered over-the-air to the computerized units of automobiles.
The framework can thwart attacks from malicious actors who can
compromise servers and networks at the manufacturing level.  Hence, it is designed to be resilient even to the best efforts of nation state
attackers. Uptane is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/),
an open source system currently used by many large OEMs, and has also been adopted by a number of U.S. and international manufacturers. Within the next few years, more than one-third of new cars on U.S. roads will include Uptane.

Currently considered the *de facto* secure standard for software updates on
automobiles, in July 2018 the [IEEE/ISTO Federation](https://ieee-isto.org/) began
formally standardizing Uptane under a non-profit consortium called the [Uptane
Alliance](https://ieee-isto.org/member_programs/uptane-alliance/). This 
step will encourage adoption and ensure clear guidance for future
users. The initial version of the [Uptane Standard document](https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html), which presents procedures for the secure design and implementation of the framework, is now available and can be accessed free of charge. Recommended deployment strategies are also currently being prepared and will be posted on this web site upon completion. Other materials, including [technical papers](https://uptane.github.io/publications.html),
[security audits](https://uptane.github.io/audits.html), and
[a public reference implementation](https://github.com/uptane/uptane)
are also freely available for all to use.
